However, the unqualified term \'salinity\' is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Sea surface salinity is often abbreviated as \'SSS\'. For the salinity of sea water at a particular depth or layer, a data variable of \'sea_water_salinity\' or one of the more precisely defined salinities should be used with a vertical coordinate axis." ;
