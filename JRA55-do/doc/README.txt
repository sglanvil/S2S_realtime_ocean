                   - land-sea mask,
                   - grid information
                   - surface temperature
                   - ice distribution
                   - Components of runoff data
                   - Grid cell area of runoff data, etc.

+ JRA55_v0.8    : Time-dependent adjustment is applied to all elements.
  (Jun2016)

+ JRA55_v1.1    : Runoff data is added. Rain and snow precipitation are replaced.

+ JRA55_v0.1    : Unadjusted JRA-55 surface atmospheric state
  (Jun2015)


  JRA55_v0.1.01 : Fix for downward short wave radiation
  (Dec2015)        - short wave radiation uses unadjusted data
                     (v0.1 actually contains adjusted data)
                   - array structure of time_bnds is corrected

+ JRA55_v0.2    : Adjusted JRA-55 surface atmospheric state
  (Jun2015)

                  Note: SLP, surface temperature, ice concentration
                        are unadjusted, thus they can be part of
                        the unadjusted data set (JRA55_v0.1*)

+ JRA55_v0.3    : JRA-55 surface atmospheric state adjusted 
  (Dec2015)       with a revised method

                  On 21Mar2016, data is extended to 2016.2.20

+ JRA55_v0.4    : Air temperature and specific humidity of v0.3
  (Dec2015)       are modified by cutting off extremely low temperature
                  south of 60S

                  On 21Mar2016, data is extended to 2016.2.20

+ JRA55-raw-v1.0 : version 1.0 of "unadjusted" data

+ JRA55-do-v1.0 : version 1.0 of official release

+ JRA55-do-v1.1 : version 1.1 of official release

+ JRA55-do-v1.2 : version 1.2 of official release
