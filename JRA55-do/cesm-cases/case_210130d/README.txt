re-run ../case_20210130  without access to, or processing of, any *monthly* COBESST data
to confirm (or disprove) that *monthly* COBESST data is not needed for our SSFCST purposes
Existing monthly data is hidden by renaming dirs containing any such data so our scripts can't find it.
JRA_step2.sh is modified so that it does not download or process any such monthly data
